This plugin enables you to extract information such as Title, URL, Categories, Tags, Author, as well as Published and Modified dates for built-in post types (e.g., post, page) or any other custom post types present on your site. You have the option to display the output in the dashboard or export it as a CSV file. This can be highly beneficial for tasks like migration, SEO analysis, and security audits.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= About Plugin Support? =

Post your question on support forum and we will try to answer your question as quick as possible.

= Why did you make this plugin?  =

We couldn't find a plugin that would export all URLs, titles and categories in a simplest possible way. So, we decided to take step further to fill this gap.

= Why the file name is randomly generated?  =

Exporting a file with a static name makes it easier for malicious attackers to discover, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. Therefore, we chose to generate random names, which are more difficult to guess. Nonetheless, the plugin offers full control over the file name if needed.

= Can I delete generated CSV file?  =

Yes, absolutely. It is highly recommended, once the file is generated, there is a direct link to delete the generated file.

= Does Export All URLs make changes to the database? =

No, the plugin does not interact with the database, as it does not have any settings or configurations to store.

= How can I check out if the plugin works for me? =

Install and activate. Go to Tools / Export All URLs. Select all options and download CSV file.

= Which PHP version do I need? =

This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.4 and greater. WordPress itself [recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). If you're using a PHP version lower than 5.4 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.

= Are there any known incompatibilities? =

Nope, there were some issues in past, but they were fixed in version 4.0.

= Are there any server requirements? =

Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.4 or higher and Wordpress version 3.1.0 or higher.
